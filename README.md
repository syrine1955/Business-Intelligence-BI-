# Carbon Footprint and Emissions Analysis of Apple Products

## Project Overview
This project, completed as part of our fourth-year studies at ESPRIT, focuses on analyzing the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions associated with Apple products. The project aims to deepen our understanding of sustainability and environmental responsibility by applying Business Intelligence (BI) principles and data science techniques. By analyzing data on Apple's product lifecycle emissions, we hope to provide valuable insights into reducing carbon footprints and enhancing sustainability practices.

## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to analyze Apple's environmental impact with the following key goals:

- **Reduce Carbon Footprint**: Predict future product emissions to guide sustainable product design.
- **Optimize Emissions**: Identify major emission sources to support reduction strategies.
- **Evaluate Financial Impact**: Analyze the relationship between sustainability initiatives and Apple's financial performance.
- **Enhance Reporting Transparency**: Create dashboards for detailed emission tracking.

## Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology:

1. **Business Understanding**: Define project objectives and data science goals.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collect and explore datasets, including greenhouse gas emissions and product lifecycle emissions.
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and transform the data through steps like handling missing values, normalization, and encoding.
4. **Modeling**: Apply predictive and optimization models for emission analysis and cost-effectiveness.
5. **Evaluation**: Validate the models to ensure they meet business objectives.
6. **Deployment**: Implement data visualization through interactive dashboards using Power BI.

## Datasets
The project utilizes three primary datasets:

- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Emissions by scope and type across Apple’s operational areas.
- **Carbon Footprint by Product**: Carbon impact of various Apple products.
- **Normalizing Factors**: Financial and employee data for analysis normalization.

## Data Visualization
Power BI was used to create dashboards for clear visualization of insights:

- **Sustainability Dashboard**: Displays emissions by product, emission type, and sustainability compliance.
- **Growth and Performance Dashboard**: Shows Apple's revenue and market growth in relation to sustainability efforts.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Modeling**: CRISP-DM framework
- **Visualization**: Power BI, DAX for calculated measures
- **Database Schema**: Snowflake Schema for optimized data warehousing and OLAP queries

## Conclusion
Through this project, we analyzed Apple’s product emissions, identified sustainability opportunities, and developed actionable insights to support environmental responsibility. This BI project reinforced our data science skills and commitment to sustainable practices in the corporate world.
